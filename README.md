Load connections for public transportation from the m.bahn.de website.

This is under heavy development. Don't expect a working solution!

Example
=
	require 'bahn.rb'
	
	agent =  Bahn::Agent.new
	routes = agent.get_routes(
		"Düsseldorf reisholz s bahn", 	# start address or station
		"Düsseldorf, Heerdter Sandberg 40 ",	# target address or station
		:include_coords => true, # include coordinates of stations
		:limit => 1,	# how many connections?
		:start_type => :station, # :station or :address
		:target_type => :address # :station or :address
		)
	# output the connection info
	routes.each {|route| route.parts.each {|part| puts part } }
	
	# or with Geocoder
	routes = agent.get_routes(
		Geocoder.search("Düsseldorf reisholz s bahn").first, 	# start address or station
		Geocoder.search("Düsseldorf, Heerdter Sandberg 40").first,	# target address or station
		:include_coords => true, # include coordinates of stations
		:limit => 1	# how many connections?
		# you don't need start- and target-type with geocoder :)
		)
	# output the connection info
	routes.each {|route| route.parts.each {|part| puts part } }
